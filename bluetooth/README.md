_asm.undocumented.bluetooth
===========================

Functions to get and set undocumented options and features within OS X.  These are undocumented features from the "private" api's for Mac OS X and are not guaranteed to work with any particular version of OS X or at all.  This code was based primarily on code samples and segments found at https://github.com/toy/blueutil.

This submodule provides access to Bluetooth availability, its power state, and the ability to change it.

I make no promises that these will work for you or work at all with any, past, current, or future versions of OS X.  I can confirm only that they didn't crash my machine during testing under 10.10. You have been warned.

### Installation

This does require that you have XCode or the XCode Command Line Tools installed.  See the App Store application or https://developer.apple.com to install these if necessary.

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm.undocumented undocumented
$ cd undocumented/bluetooth
$ [HS_APPLICATION=/Applications] [PREFIX=~/.hammerspoon] make install
~~~

If Hammerspoon.app is in your /Applications folder, you may leave `HS_APPLICATION=/Applications` out and if you are fine with the module being installed in your Hammerspoon configuration directory, you may leave `PREFIX=~/.hammerspoon` out as well.  For most people, it will probably be sufficient to just type `make install`.

### Require

~~~lua
bluetooth = require("hs._asm.undocumented.bluetooth")
~~~

### Functions
~~~lua
bluetooth.available() -> bool
~~~
Returns `true` or `false`, indicating whether bluetooth is available on this machine.

~~~lua
bluetooth.power([bool]) -> bool
~~~
If an argument is provided, set bluetooth power state to on (`true`) or off (`false`) and returns the (possibly new) status. If no argument is provided, then this function returns `true` or `false`, indicating whether bluetooth is currently enabled for this machine.
