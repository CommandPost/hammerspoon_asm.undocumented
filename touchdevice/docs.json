If you have corrected information or observe something in variance with what is documented here, please submit an issue with as much detail as possible.\n\nThe table will contain the following key-value pairs:\n  * `frame`            - an integer specifying the observation frame this touch belongs to\n  * `timestamp`        - a number representing the timestamp for the touch data in seconds; the epoch (0.0 point) is uncertain, but for a given device, the number will always be increasing throughout the detection of touches for the device.\n  * `pathIndex`        - an integer representing the path through the various stages for a touch; as long as a specific touch has not been broken (i.e. reached the \"notTracking\" stage), it's path ID will remain constant even though it's relative position in the table of touches returned in a frame callback may differ.\n  * `stage`            - a string representing the stage of the touch.  May be one of the following values:\n    * `notTracking`   - The touch has completed and no further path updates with this pathIndex will occur\n    * `startInRange`  - This is a newly detected touch\n    * `hoverInRange`  - The touch is hovering slightly above the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `makeTouch`     - The touch has actually made full contact with the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `touching`      - The touch is established. The touch will be in this stage for the majority of its lifetime.\n    * `breakTouch`    - The touch has been lifted from the touch device.\n    * `lingerInRange` - The touch has been lifted but is still within the range of hover detection.\n    * `outOfRange`    - The touch has moved out of range; This may occur because the touch has ended and will be followed by a `notTracking` message or it can occur if the touch moves out of the touch sensitive area of the device; if the touch returns to the touch sensitive area quickly enough, the touch may continue with `touching` messages.  Otherwise a new touch with a new `pathIndex` and `fingerID` will be generated if the touch returns.\n  * `fingerID`         - an integer which appears to be related to the location of the touch device where the touch was first detected; however this is not known for certain.  Like pathIndex, this number will remain constant through the lifetime of a specific touch.\n  * `handID`           - an integer, usually 1, of uncertain purpose; it appears to have to do with finger grouping, but has not been observed consistently enough with a differing value to determine conclusively\n  * `normalizedVector` - a table representing the current postion and velocity of the touch normalized so that all values are numbers between 0.0 and 1.0\n    * `position` - a table representing the position of the touch\n      * `x` - a number from 0.0 (the left) to 1.0 (the right) indicating the horizontal position of the touch relative to the touch sensitive surface area of the touch device.\n      * `y` - a number from 0.0 (the bottom) to 1.0 (the top) indicating the vertical position of the touch relative to the touch sensitive surface area of the touch device.\n    * `velocity` - a table representing the current velocity of the changes to the touch\n      * `x` - a number from -1.0 to 1.0 representing the rate and direction of change to the horizontal position of the touch\n      * `y` - a number from -1.0 to 1.0 representing the rate and direction of change to the vertical position of the touch\n  * `zTotal`           - a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing a general measure of the surface area covered by the touch; this can be used as an approximation of pressure as more of the finger will be touching as pressure increases.\n  * `zPressure`        - on force touch devices, this number appears to represent the relative pressure being applied with the touch; on non-force touch devices this number is 0.0.\n  * `angle`            - a number representing the angle of the touch ellipse\n  * `majorAxis`        - a number representing the major axis of the touch ellipse\n  * `minorAxis`        - a number representing the minor axis of the touch ellipse\n  * `absoluteVector`   - a table representing the current position and velocity of the touch.  Note that the possible range for the values available in this table appears to be device dependent and does not appear to be related in an obvious way to the devices surface dimensions as returned by [hs._asm.undocumented.touchdevice:surfaceDimensions](#surfaceDimensions).\n    * `position` - a table representing the position of the touch\n      * `x` - a number indicating the horizontal position of the touch. This number will be negative if the touch is in the left half of the touch sensitive surface area and positive if it is in the right half.\n      * `y` - a number indicating the vertical position of the touch.  This number starts at 0 at the bottom of the device and increases positively as the touch approaches the top.\n    * `velocity` - a table representing the current velocity of the changes to the touch\n      * `x` - a number representing the rate and direction of change to the horizontal position of the touch\n      * `y` - a number representing the rate and direction of change to the vertical position of the touch\n  * `zDensity`         - a number representing the density of the touch; in my observations this will fluctuate greatly for fingers but be more constant for a stylus, so it may be useful for gauging what the source of the touch is from.\n\n  * `_field14`         - an integer; currently the purpose of this field in the touch structure is unknown; at present only a value of 0 has been observed.\n  * `_field15`         - an integer; currently the purpose of this field in the touch structure is unknown; at present only a value of 0 has been observed.",
